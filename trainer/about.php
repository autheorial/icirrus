			<div id="trainerinfo"><p style="clear: both;">You've found <mball>Masterball</mball>, my self-indulgent domain showing off my love of Pok&eacute;mon! Welcome to the <i>Trainer</i> section, which stores my history with the game series as well as info for all my pok&eacute;mon teams that mean so much to me <b>&hearts;</b></p>
	<p><img src="trainer.gif" class="trainerimg">I've been into Pok&eacute;mon since 1998, when the anime first came out; but I didn't get my first game until August 2003 after watching my camp friends play it all summer. My first game was <ruby>Pokemon Ruby</ruby>, which I got with my original Gameboy SP. (It's broken now.) I was nine-years old at the time, and so obsessed that some of my classmates nicknamed me "Pok&eacute;mon Master."</p> 
<p>I'm still obsessed. And still a Pok&eacute;mon Master.</p>
	<p>Since then, I've played and owned at least one game in every generation that's come out. My trainer name in nearly every game is ALICE in all caps, since that was the name I gave my first trainer. That way, as the years pass, the OT looks consistent.</p>
	
	<p>I memorized the Kanto Pok&eacute;mon rap for fun in March 2018. Feel free to ask for proof.</p>
