Personal archive of my love and history with Pokemon. 

Project began February 2017; last stylistic/functional update in spring 2018.
The Pokemon Go section is being continuously updated as the app adds new Pokemon.

All graphics &copy; Nintendo, Niantic, or created by me with obvious inspiration
from the Pokemon franchise.

### &mdash; Trainer 
This section has each game I've played in full, with a display of the most prominent
party I used for the corresponding game, or the only party if I've played the game
only once. The front page has an in-page 'pop up' box that serves as an 'about me'
section of the website; the party is my top favorite Pokemon, but not in order.

Parties contain nearly all details per Pokemon, including nickname, species,
gender, typing, nature/characteristic, level, ribbons (if applicable), and moveset. Each game page contains
the game name (e.g. Fire Red, Black), region, year I played, and a small blurb
on my experience with the game.

### &mdash; Gym
More or less an extras or further site information section, with:
* **_Fight_** - About the website, contact form, 3DS friend code, web cliques, linkback buttons
* **_Pokemon_** - Pokemon Go archive
* **_Bag_** - Site map
* **_Run_** - Exit links and affiliates
